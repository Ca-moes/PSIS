I send you the literature for database security topic in the attachment.

Concerning the code, you need to know GRANT, REVOKE, SET ROLE (both logic and syntax),
and the syntax for VIEWs.
 
Additional (optional) readings about database access control:

- http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Mandatory,_Discretionary,_Role_and_Rule_Based_Access_Control
- www.windowsecurity.com/uplarticle/2/Access_Control_WP.pdf
- [DEPRECATED] https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Access_Control_Cheat_Sheet
	   [NEW] https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html

You have to be able to explain mandatory, discretionary and rule based access control.
